### What is Regression?

Regression is a type of analysis in machine learning in which we try to analyze the relationship between a dependent variables and independent variable(s).

1. Linear Regression --> answers us in the form of _How much_
2. Logistic Regression --> answers us in the form of _yes/no_

Here we use **Linear regression**.

### Linear Regression

Linear regression analysis is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable. The variable you are using to predict the other variable's value is called the independent variable.
